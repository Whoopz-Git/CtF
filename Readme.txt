// This file was auto-generated by uMod Build Engine 2.0 for 'CtF Testing Branch'
#Mod Requirements
	uMod version: 2.9.4 or newer
	Unity version: 2022.3.53f1

#Notes:
- The folder 'CtF Testing Branch' is known as the 'Mod Folder' and this is where the 'Mod Logic' should be placed (scenes, prefabs and scripts)
- The folder 'CtF Testing Branch Source' is known as the 'Content Folder' and this is where 'Mod Assets' (materials, textures, meshes, etc.) should be placed that are referenced by the 'Mod Logic' in 'Mod Folder'.
- The 'Mod Logic' can reference assets outside of 'Content Folder', they will be included in the build.

#Warnings:
- Any 'Mod Assets' moved into the 'Mod Folder', that are referenced by the 'Mod Logic', will be included twice causing the mod size to increase unnecessarily!
